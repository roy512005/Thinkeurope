                                    will solely be granted to applicants meeting the outlined criteria or those who have

                                    consent to this process to preempt last-minute complications. By taking this
                                    proactive approach, clients can prepare for all prerequisites ahead of the
                                    immigration authorities&#39; announcements. If a client&#39;s profile doesn&#39;t
                                    align with the criteria post-announcement, alternative options may be explored.</p>

                                <p><strong>3.</strong> Think Europe Services strictly prohibits chargebacks. Customers
                                    who dispute a valid credit card payment will face permanent suspension from
                                    utilizing our services. Any outstanding charges and fees will be forwarded to
                                    collections, and if necessary, unpaid debts will be reported to relevant Credit
                                    Reporting Agencies.</p>

                                <p><strong>4.</strong> Your bill will encompass the Think Europe Services consultation
                                    fee and applicable taxes. In the event of a refund request, it will solely apply to
                                    the consultation fee, as taxes are non-refundable.</p>

                                <p><strong>5.</strong> In cases of application rejection by Immigration and Visa
                                    Authorities, Think Europe Services will refund the stipulated amount as outlined in
                                    the agreement. To initiate the refund process, please submit a refund claim form
                                    along with the rejection letter from the authority to Think Europe Services. Refunds
                                    will be processed within 35 working days from receipt of the claim form. It&#39;s
                                    essential to include the rejection letter or passport stamp for eligibility.
                                    Furthermore, you must furnish the refund request form and a copy of your payment
                                    receipt to Think Europe Services; failure to do so will render you ineligible for a
                                    refund.</p>

                                <p><strong>6.</strong> Our company cannot be held responsible for delays caused by
                                    third-party services or external factors, such as courier services. Regrettably,
                                    clients are not eligible for refunds on any service charges incurred due to such
                                    delays.</p>

                                <p><strong>7.</strong> Think Europe Services is unable to offer refunds for any fees or
                                    charges paid to Assessing Bodies, Immigration Authorities, or Embassy/Consulate/High
                                    Commission in case a client&#39;s immigration request is rejected or not approved by
                                    the respective authority. It&#39;s crucial to understand that our fees exclusively
                                    cover the services provided by our organization and do not encompass any assessment
                                    or request fees. We request that clients assume responsibility for covering any
                                    additional costs that may apply.</p>

                                <p><strong>8.</strong> Prior to initiating any chargebacks or payment withdrawals, the
                                    applicant must promptly notify Think Europe Services if payment has been made
                                    through an online card service. This requirement is also applicable to CC Avenue,
                                    unless refund policies explicitly stated in the agreement and lawful procedures
                                    within the jurisdiction of Warsaw, State of Masovian Poland, are meticulously
                                    followed.</p>

                                <p><strong>9.</strong> When using net banking or a credit card for payment, the
                                    applicant agrees not to dispute the charge or request a chargeback from the
                                    designated bank. The applicant also commits to refraining from requesting the bank
                                    to cancel or withhold the payment made to Think Europe Services. In the event of
                                    card loss or misuse, the applicant should inform their bank that the charge to Think
                                    Europe Services is valid and should not be canceled or charged back. The applicant
                                    is expected to cooperate with Think Europe Services in any defense or representation
                                    before any bank or authority.</p>

                                <p><strong>10.</strong> Think Europe Services establishes its service charges based on
                                    its internal standards, not market prices, and clients accept these charges upon
                                    registration. Any complaints regarding the costs being deemed too high after
                                    registration will not be entertained. This information is clearly communicated to
                                    clients during registration to ensure they are fully informed before agreeing to the
                                    charges.</p>

                                <p><strong>11.</strong> As part of the immigration process, the applicant must provide
                                    proof of sufficient funds, the specific amount varying depending on the country and
                                    the application category or method. The applicant acknowledges and complies with all
                                    these requirements set by the relevant authorities or immigration agencies. Think
                                    Europe Services will not entertain refund requests for service charges if the
                                    applicant fails to demonstrate the required funds. Refund requests for service
                                    charges will not be considered in such instances.</p>

                                <p><strong>12.</strong> According to the client declaration agreement, any registrations
                                    made with Think Europe Services for countries before the agreed-upon date will be
                                    deemed invalid. Consequently, clients can only seek fees or services after receiving
                                    written confirmation from Think Europe Services.</p>

                                <p><strong>13.</strong> A refund can only be processed in cases where the visa is
                                    accepted due to the following reasons:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the visa applicant misses their scheduled interview.</li>
                                    <li>If the applicant must adhere more closely to the consulate or embassy&#39;s
                                        requirements and regulations.</li>
                                    <li>If the applicant or their family members fail to meet the necessary medical
                                        examination criteria during the application process.</li>
                                    <li>If the applicant is unable to provide a valid and compelling Police Clearance
                                        Certificate within three months, this may lead to application denial.</li>
                                    <li>If the client or their family members included in the application cannot
                                        demonstrate sufficient settlement funds, it will result in potential application
                                        failure.</li>
                                    <li>If the applicant or any of their family members mentioned in the application
                                        have a history of violating visa or immigration laws, potentially impacting the
                                        application outcome.</li>
                                    <li>If the applicant submits any additional documents late, as per the
                                        consulate&#39;s requirements.</li>
                                    <li>In accordance with the guidance provided by the Think Europe Services
                                        consultant, it is obligatory for the client to obtain the required Language
                                        certificate/ IELTS/French test score to meet the eligibility criteria.</li>
                                    <li>Refunds are only applicable if the applicant withdraws their case within three
                                        months of registration.</li>
                                    <li>If there is no communication with your Process Consultant for 30 days, your case
                                        will be considered abandoned and handled accordingly.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>14.</strong> The application fee paid to visa authorities or any other
                                    institution is the sole responsibility and liability of the client. It is not
                                    included in the service charges, and Think Europe Services will not entertain refund
                                    claims in the event of rejection.</p>

                                <p><strong>15.</strong> Think Europe Services can efficiently prepare and process
                                    documentation for submission to the relevant assessment/immigration authority, but
                                    the client must provide all necessary documents, forms, and information within 30
                                    days. Failure to do so may result in the advisory/consulting fee paid to Think
                                    Europe Services not being refunded.</p>

                                <p><strong>16.</strong> Effective communication requires the client to promptly inform
                                    Think Europe Services of any messages received from the visa office, whether through
                                    phone calls or written correspondence, within one week of receipt. Additionally, the
                                    client must notify the immigration consultancy of any phone calls or written
                                    communication with the relevant visa bureau within seven days. This includes
                                    personal visits to the visa office and any inquiries made over the phone.
                                    Non-compliance with these requirements means no refunds will be issued for
                                    secretarial services provided by Think Europe Services.</p>

                                <p><strong>17.</strong> According to the visa processing agency&#39;s schedule and
                                    location requirements, clients must attend all interviews at their own expense and
                                    follow any instructions given by the agency without fail. Failure to comply may
                                    result in forfeiting secretarial fees paid to Think Europe Services. The client is
                                    expected to be present for all required interviews.</p>

                                <p><strong>18.</strong> If an application or petition is rejected due to payment issues,
                                    the applicant cannot dispute the withdrawal. Therefore, it is the applicant&#39;s
                                    responsibility to pay the fee and select a payment method.</p>

                                <p><strong>19.</strong> It is acknowledged that submitting an immigration application is
                                    not a routine or fixed process, and the case officer handling the application may
                                    request additional documents as per changing norms. These additional documents may
                                    need to be submitted to the relevant immigration authorities. Unfortunately, refund
                                    requests based on this reason will not be accepted.</p>

                                <p><strong>20.</strong> As a client, it&#39;s important to understand and agree that if
                                    you abandon your request or decide to withdraw after signing up, Think Europe
                                    Services will not refund or transfer your fees to another individual, whether a
                                    friend or relative.</p>

                                <p><strong>21.</strong> The client is accountable for providing all necessary
                                    information and documents, including English translations, in the required format as
                                    requested by Think Europe Services and the relevant office. Think Europe Services
                                    has agreed to work with the client based on the information and documents provided.
                                    However, if the provided information is inaccurate, false, incomplete, or incorrect,
                                    the immigration authorities will not consider the application. Think Europe Services
                                    is not responsible for any adverse outcome or rejection of the application due to
                                    inaccurate information provided by the client. In such cases, no refunds will be
                                    issued for consulting fees or government fees.</p>

                                <p><strong>22.</strong> Think Europe Services retains the right to terminate or withdraw
                                    its services without refunding the client&#39;s service fee under the following
                                    conditions:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Failure to submit all required documents within one month from the date of
                                        registration, which is the standard procedure, may result in a late fee
                                        assessment.</li>
                                    <li>Any attempts to harm the Company&#39;s reputation or disrupt its operations are
                                        considered unacceptable.</li>
                                    <li>The client&#39;s lack of response to the Company&#39;s emails and phone calls
                                        for a period exceeding one month, along with a personal decision to withdraw.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Reasonable suspicion by Think Europe Services that someone other than the client
                                        is attempting to access the Service for their own benefit.</li>
                                    <li>If Think Europe Services determines that the client&#39;s behavior hinders the
                                        consultant&#39;s ability to provide services, the Company reserves the right to
                                        take appropriate action.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>23.</strong> By signing this agreement, the client commits to complying with
                                    all assessment requirements and decisions made by the relevant authorities.
                                    Additionally, if requested, the client agrees to furnish all necessary
                                    documentation, including original copies. It&#39;s important to note that Think
                                    Europe Services cannot be held accountable for any failure on the client&#39;s part
                                    to submit the required documents. Consequently, the inability to provide the
                                    necessary documentation cannot serve as a valid reason for a refund claim.</p>

                                <p><strong>24.</strong> The client is responsible for covering all fees owed to various
                                    government agencies, skill assessment organizations, and language testing entities.
                                    This includes but is not limited to, costs related to skill assessments, residency
                                    permit application fees, expenses associated with taking approved language tests,
                                    health examinations, and more. Regardless of the outcome of the petition, these fees
                                    are unequivocally non-refundable and not subject to negotiation by any receiving
                                    offices or immigration consultancy. While the immigration consultancy has no control
                                    over the final decision at any stage of the petition process, the concerned
                                    organization retains sole authority to make a favorable evaluation or determination.
                                    Think Europe Services has not provided any guarantees regarding the assessment or
                                    outcome of the client&#39;s prospective petition at any juncture.</p>

                                <p><strong>25.</strong> The client must promptly inform Think Europe Services of any
                                    updates related to changes in housing or mailing address, educational or
                                    professional qualifications, marital status, employment or company changes, the
                                    birth of new children, or any involvement in legal matters or police cases after
                                    petition submission and throughout the process until the Permanent Residence Permit
                                    is granted. Failure to do so will signify that no advisory fees paid to the
                                    immigration consultancy are eligible for a refund.</p>

                                <p><strong>26.</strong> The client is required to undertake an acceptable English
                                    language test or another language test as deemed necessary and must achieve a score
                                    at least equal to the group average in each of the four assessment categories:
                                    listening, reading, writing, and speaking, as stipulated by the issuing authority or
                                    assessment body. The client fully comprehends and agrees that their petition cannot
                                    be submitted without the mandated acceptable English language or other language
                                    tests (if applicable), including those for their partner or dependents aged 18 and
                                    above. Failure to pass the requisite acceptable language tests will not result in
                                    any reimbursement of advisory, consulting, or secretarial services fees provided to
                                    Think Europe Services.</p>

                                <p><strong>27.</strong> The client is also responsible for ensuring that they are
                                    married or in a relationship that qualifies for dependent status and that acceptable
                                    dependents appear for Acceptable English language or other language tests, if
                                    required, achieving a minimum score as specified in the agreed-upon SERVICE LEVEL
                                    AGREEMENT with Think Europe Services.</p>

                                <p><strong>28.</strong> By signing or acknowledging this agreement to utilize our
                                    services, the client relinquishes their right to withdraw from the procedure at any
                                    point due to changes in their circumstances. No refunds or settlements should be
                                    expected. Once services have been initiated or any part of the process has
                                    commenced, refund claims cannot be accommodated by us as a business with substantial
                                    investments.</p>

                                <p><strong>29.</strong> The secretarial fees paid to Think Europe Services exclusively
                                    cover the consultancy&#39;s services and obligations as outlined and determined in
                                    the SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT separately agreed upon with the client, and they do not
                                    encompass any payments to government agencies, language testing companies, or any
                                    other entities.</p>

                                <p><strong>30.</strong> The client must inform Think Europe Services if they wish to
                                    utilize alternative services provided by authorized global entities
                                    (Embassy/Consulate/Language Test Conducting Centers, Health Check Conducting
                                    Centers, etc.) and must also pay additional fees to Think Europe Services for such
                                    services, as specified and agreed upon in the SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT separately
                                    signed with the client. Online payments made do not include fees owed to these
                                    authorized global entities (Embassy/Consulate/Language Test Conducting Centers,
                                    Health Check Conducting Centers, etc.), and these charges are non-refundable.</p>

                                <p><strong>31.</strong> The client acknowledges their explicit awareness of the typical
                                    wait times/average processing times relevant to their specific permit category and
                                    acknowledges that these times are entirely dependent on the discretion of the
                                    office/appraisal body in question. The client understands and accepts that no
                                    refunds will be issued for charges, whether made on-site or off-site, due to
                                    extended petition processing times.</p>

                                <p><strong>32.</strong> Think Europe Services has not provided any assurance, guidance,
                                    or guarantee regarding employment or job prospects following permit approval and
                                    relocation to any specific foreign destination. No compensation will be sought for
                                    advisory/consulting/secretarial service charges already paid to Think Europe
                                    Services due to the absence of a job guarantee abroad.</p>

                                <p><strong>33.</strong> In the event of a dispute or conflict related to a client&#39;s
                                    payment to Think Europe Services for the SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT duly signed with
                                    Think Europe Services, Think Europe Services&#39;s liability, if any, whether
                                    monetary or otherwise, shall not exceed and will be limited to the charges offered
                                    to Think Europe Services as advisory/consulting/secretarial fees as part of the
                                    legally executed SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT.</p>

                                <p><strong>34.</strong> Certain countries operate with a cap system, meaning the
                                    approval of a Green Card/Permanent Residence/visa is contingent upon the cap not
                                    being reached for that year. Even if the client meets the required points as
                                    determined by the immigration authorities of the specified country, they may still
                                    be denied the Green Card/Permanent Residence/Visa if the cap for that year has been
                                    reached. The failure to obtain a Green Card/Permanent Residence due to cap limits
                                    cannot be used as grounds for seeking a refund, and the client is fully aware of
                                    this.</p>

                                <p><strong>35.</strong> If a refund request aligns with the approved terms and
                                    conditions of the Company and the service agreement, it will take 15-30 working days
                                    to process.</p>

                                <p><strong>36.</strong> The stated service fee covers the full service as of the
                                    registration date and is solely applicable to an individual&#39;s request. Any
                                    assumptions of extended services to family members or children are entirely at the
                                    customer&#39;s discretion, and the company cannot be held responsible for such
                                    assumptions.</p>

                                <p><strong>37.</strong> The client is obligated to truthfully disclose to Think Europe
                                    Services all details pertaining to any existing or past allegations of wrongdoing,
                                    convictions, or insolvency against themselves and others relying on them. Failure to
                                    disclose such information, if later discovered, will not result in any refunds of
                                    funds provided to Think Europe Services.</p>

                                <p><strong>38.</strong> Think Europe Services is committed to safeguarding client
                                    confidentiality and privacy. Therefore, Think Europe Services takes reasonable
                                    measures to protect the personal information collected against misuse, loss,
                                    unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Personal information about the
                                    client (and, if applicable, the client&#39;s family) may be used and disclosed for
                                    the primary purpose for which it was obtained, reasonably expected secondary
                                    purposes related to the primary purpose, and in other circumstances authorized by
                                    the Privacy Act. Think Europe Services typically shares the client&#39;s personal
                                    information for the following purposes:</p>

                                <p>The client has carefully read the above provisions, agrees to them, and commits to
                                    abiding by all the terms and conditions outlined in this agreement.</p>

                                    Warsaw, Poland. The laws of the Government of Poland and the State Government of

                                <p>Force Majeure: The Company shall not be liable for any failure or delay in fulfilling
                                    its obligations under this agreement caused directly or indirectly by circumstances
                                    beyond its control. These circumstances may include strikes, work stoppages,
                                    accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or
                                    natural disasters, acts of God, outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, interruptions,
                                    loss, or malfunctions of utilities. In such cases, the company will make reasonable
                                    efforts to resume service as soon as possible. Please note that your file will be

                                <p>Chargeback: The client acknowledges that Think Europe Services incurs significant
                                    costs in deploying personnel and utilizing infrastructure to provide services.
                                    Regardless of the outcome of the request, the client agrees not to seek a refund of
